<q>"This one moment when you know you're not a sad story. You are alive, and you stand up and see the lights on the buildings

      most in this world. And in this moment I swear, we are infinite."

<!--quote 3-->

<p>"The voice of the sea is seductive; never ceasing, whispering, clamoring, murmuring, inviting the soul to wander for a spell in abysses of solitude; to lose itself in 
    mazes of inward contemplation.  The voice of the sea speaks to the soul. The touch of the sea is sensuous, enfolding the body in its soft, close embrace."
    - The Awakening by Kate Chopin
